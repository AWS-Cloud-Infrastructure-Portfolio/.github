## Implemented Cloud Infrastructure Scenarios

- **IAM & Access Control** – Fine-grained access using users, roles, policies and least-privilege design.
- **Networking & VPC Architecture** – Segmentation with public/private subnets, NAT gateways, bastion hosts and Terraform-managed infrastructure.
- **Compute & Instance Hardening** – EC2 configuration, SSH best practices, SSM automation and baseline hardening.
- **Logging & Monitoring** – Centralized visibility using CloudTrail, GuardDuty, Config, CloudWatch and Athena.
- **Storage Configuration** – S3 access policies, encryption and misconfiguration detection.
- **Incident Detection & Response** – Automated detection and response workflows using GuardDuty, Lambda and CloudTrail.
- **CI/CD Pipelines** – AWS CI/CD pipelines with access controls and automated checks.
- **Serverless Architectures** – API Gateway, Lambda, WAF, Cognito and secure serverless design.
